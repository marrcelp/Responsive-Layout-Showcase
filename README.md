# Responsive Layout Showcase

See the live version of this project ‚Äì [Responsive Layout Showcase](https://marrcelp.github.io/Responsive-Layout-Showcase/)

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my skills in **Responsive Web Design (RWD)** and **CSS layout techniques**. The website was built with a mobile-first approach and uses a multi-file structure to organize styles for different screen sizes: `mobile.css`, `tablet.css`, and `desktop.css`.  
The design is fully responsive and adapts to various screen widths to provide an optimal user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

The project simulates a landing page for an app promotion, with multiple sections including:  
**Hero, Features, Reviews, Pricing Plans, App Downloads, Footer, and Navigation** ‚Äì all styled and structured to follow modern web development practices.

## üñ•Ô∏è Layout scaling preview

| Device        | Media Query                | File             |
|---------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Mobile        | `max-width: 767px`         | `mobile.css`     |
| Tablet        | `768px to 1199px`          | `tablet.css`     |
| Desktop       | `min-width: 1200px`        | `desktop.css`    |

Each breakpoint has its own stylesheet for clarity and scalability.

## üí≠ Conclusions for future projects

I would like to improve:

### More advanced accessibility
Making all sections more accessible using semantic HTML elements.

### CSS Optimization
Exploring CSS preprocessors like **SASS** to write more maintainable styles.

### Using CSS frameworks
Trying out frameworks such as **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** to speed up layout creation and improve scalability.
